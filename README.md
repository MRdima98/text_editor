# Text editor

We are writing a text editor from *scratch*.

~~We will do that in Go and C, because I like *fun*.~~

Turns out there is a [Go implementation of XCB](https://github.com/jezek/xgb).
I like freebies as the next guy so don't mind me. Saved from C today, but one day 
I will go back to formula.

## Features
[ ] Type each letter
[ ] Delete text
[x] Cursor
[ ] Special combinations (copy paste)
[ ] Vim mode (optional)
[ ] Basic LSP server (optional)
